# Jarbas

### Jarbas is a voice powered shopping assistant built for the 48h hackaton of Pixels Camp 2016.

Ever been in a situation where you notice that you're missing something in your house, you need to buy it but then forget to add that product to your shopping list? Well now with Jarbas, you don't need to open your note app to write down your shopping list. Simply say "Jarbas" to your phone (Android) or using the Jarbas Webapp (Chrome only) and let it help you note your shopping list. Jarbas will be listening to what you want to find and save the list for you. Once you're done, you can ask him to email you the list or request for the groceries to be delivered at your place (using Continente's API). Never forget that toilet paper anymore! Jarbas is here for you!
